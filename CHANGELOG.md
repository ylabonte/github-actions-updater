## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9eae823: Drop Node 20 support; require Node 22+.

  Node 20 left LTS at the end of April 2026, so the project drops it from its supported runtimes. The CLI is now tested on Node 22 and Node 24, with Node 24 as the build/release default. `package.json`'s `engines.node` bumps from `>=20.0.0` to `>=22.0.0`.

  **What this means in practice:** the `engines` field is advisory — npm will print a warning when installing on Node 20 but will still complete the install. Configurations with `engine-strict=true` will refuse outright. The CLI itself uses no Node 22+ APIs in this release, so unaffected users on Node 20 are likely to keep working for a while — but any regression observed on Node 20 will not be treated as a bug, and CI will not catch one.

  **What to do if you're on Node 20:** upgrade your runner to Node 22 or Node 24. There are no source-level API changes in this release; the bump is policy-only.

  Why this isn't a major: the `engines` field is a soft contract, no runtime API changed, and the package is young enough that burning a 2.0.0 on a Node-support narrowing alone would make the version stream noisier than it needs to be. A loud changelog entry captures the contract change without committing the version number.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 10601b3: Add config-file support via cosmiconfig.

  Repo-level defaults can now live in a **data-only** config file at the repo root — a `ghau` key in `package.json`, `.ghaurc`, `.ghaurc.json`, `.ghaurc.yaml`, `.ghaurc.yml`, or `ghau.config.json`. CLI flags override config values; config values override built-in defaults. Tokens are deliberately _not_ loadable from config — they belong in env vars or `gh auth token`.

  Schema (validated by zod; unknown keys are rejected):

  ```ts
  interface GhauConfig {
    target?: 'latest' | 'major' | 'minor' | 'patch' | 'greatest';
    filters?: string[];
    rejects?: string[];
    workflowsDir?: string;
    allowBranchPin?: boolean;
    failOnOutdated?: boolean;
  }
  ```

  Relative `workflowsDir` values are resolved against the config file's directory (not `process.cwd()`), so a repo-level `.ghaurc.json` keeps pointing at `<repo-root>/.github/workflows` regardless of which subdirectory inside the repo you invoke `ghau` from. **Containment is enforced** — a `workflowsDir` that is absolute (any platform-recognized form, including Windows drive-absolute and UNC even on POSIX), that contains a backslash (Windows-only separator; rejected for portability), that resolves outside the config file's directory via `..`-traversal, or whose realpath escapes the config tree through a symlink is rejected at load time. Repo-controlled configs can therefore only point at directories inside the repo, and behave identically on POSIX and Windows runners; operators who legitimately need an absolute path can still pass `--workflows` on the CLI.

  Rationale: a checked-in config is reachable by anyone who can land a PR, and — in `--write` mode — steering the YAML rewriter outside the repo would be a real attack vector. The validation closes that vector before the scanner ever opens a file.

  **Executable config formats (`.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.ts`) are intentionally not supported.** Allowing them would let `ghau` execute repository-controlled JavaScript during config discovery — and in the composite Action path, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is already in the process environment by the time the CLI starts, so a checked-in `ghau.config.mjs` from an attacker-controlled PR could exfiltrate it. Keeping the config surface data-only eliminates that vector; an opt-in for executable formats may land in a future minor with appropriate CI safeguards. See `docs/guide/config-file.md` for the full rationale.

  ## Also in this release: Action-side contract changes

  To make the config-file precedence work end-to-end when the tool runs as a composite Action, several Action inputs gained new "defer to config" semantics:
  - **`target` input default changed** from `'latest'` to an empty string. When omitted, the Action no longer forces `--target latest` on the CLI; the CLI then honors a `target` value from a repo config file (or falls through to its own built-in `latest` default if no config). Set the input explicitly to force a value over any config.
  - **`workflows` input behavior clarified.** The input itself already defaulted to an empty string in 1.0.0; what's new is that an empty value now lets the CLI honor `workflowsDir` from a repo config file (previously it just fell through to the CLI's built-in `.github/workflows`). The Action's metadata description has been updated to reflect this; no Action-input default change.
  - **`allow-branch-pin` and `fail-on-outdated` inputs** are now tri-state. Empty (the new default) defers to the config; `'true'` appends the positive CLI flag; `'false'` appends a new negative CLI flag (`--no-allow-branch-pin` / `--no-fail-on-outdated`) so a one-off run can override a config-set `true` back to `false` without editing the config. **Back-compat for 1.0.x pins**: if a caller explicitly pins `version: '1.0.x'` and sets the tri-state input to `'false'`, the older CLI doesn't know the negative flag and would crash. To preserve the pre-1.1 behavior (where `false` was effectively a no-op — `false` matched the CLI's built-in default already), the Action detects a `1.0.x` version pin and treats `false` as a no-op + warning rather than emitting the new flag. Defaults (`version: '1'`) inherit `1.1.0` once published and aren't affected.

  The new CLI flags `--no-allow-branch-pin` and `--no-fail-on-outdated` are also available directly for non-Action invocations.

  Action users with `with: { target: latest }` / `with: { workflows: .github/workflows }` explicitly set in their workflows are unaffected. Action users who _omit_ those inputs will now inherit the config file's values (or fall through to the unchanged CLI defaults if no config) — the documented "Action input > config file > built-in default" precedence.

## 1.0.0

Initial public release of `github-actions-updater` — an `ncu`-style CLI and composite GitHub Action for keeping the `uses:` references in your workflow files up to date.

### CLI (`ghau`)

- **Scans** `.github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}` for outdated remote `uses:` references and renders a colored summary table (or `--json` for machine-readable output).
- **Reference styles supported**: floating major (`@v4`), floating minor (`@v4.1`), exact (`@v4.1.1`), SHA-pinned with version comment (`@<sha> # v4.1.1`), branch (`@main` — reported as mutable), Docker (`docker://image:tag`). Local refs (`./...`) are skipped.
- **Floating partial tags are pre-resolved**: `@v4` against `v4.7.0` is up-to-date; only cross-track moves (`v4` → `v5`, `v4.1` → `v4.2`) are flagged. On `--write`, partial refs preserve their style: `@v4` rewrites to `@v5`, not `@v5.0.0`.
- **`-u` / `--write`** applies updates in place. Surgical text-splice preserves comments and formatting; no AST round-trip.
- **`-i` / `--interactive`** picks updates from a multi-select prompt.
- **`--commit`** stages the rewritten files and produces a `git commit -v` with a pre-filled message (first-line summary + one bullet per updated action). Combine with `--no-edit` (or rely on auto-detection when stdin isn't a TTY) for a fully non-interactive commit suitable for CI.
- **Auth chain**: `--token <token>` → `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` env → `gh auth token` → anonymous (60 req/hour).
- **`--target` policy**: `latest` (default), `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `greatest`.
- **`--filter` / `--reject`** with glob patterns over action names.
- **`--fail-on-outdated`** turns the scan into a CI gate. By default scans exit 0 even when outdated entries are present.
- **Exit codes**: `0` on a successful scan, `1` for partial resolution errors or `--fail-on-outdated` + drift, `2` when every resolution errored (auth/network).
- **Cross-platform paths**: POSIX-normalized in display and JSON output on every platform, including Windows.
- **Display polish**: green ✓ in the Δ column for up-to-date rows, yellow ⚠ for error rows.

### Composite GitHub Action

`github-actions-updater` is also consumable as a GitHub Action wrapper around the CLI:

```yaml
- uses: ylabonte/github-actions-updater@v1
  with:
    write: true
    commit: true
```

- Composite action; delegates to `npx github-actions-updater@<version>` so the npm package stays the single source of truth (no bundled JS blob, no double-update path).
- All CLI flags are mirrored as workflow inputs.
- Exposes `outdated`, `changes`, and `json` outputs for downstream composition.
- Pairs cleanly with [`peter-evans/create-pull-request`](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) for an auto-PR flow.
- The floating `v<major>` tag (e.g. `v1`) tracks the latest 1.x.y release automatically.

See the README's "Use as a GitHub Action" section and the [extended docs](https://ylabonte.github.io/github-actions-updater/guide/use-as-action) for recipes (auto-PR, drift report, hard CI gate, monorepo, version pinning).

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g github-actions-updater
